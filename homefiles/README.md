## README file

The bashrc file has a script inside that runs when I start a new session. Aliases included are invoked.

## Awesome bash aliases
- The usefulness behind these is that shortcuts are made to lessen the work by shortnening the commands.
- Mine had pinging facebook and google shortened to `pt` and `pg`, respectively.
- These two were in the bashrc file
  
## The ultimate BA bashrc file
- I also added cls to clear the screen.
- `da` shows the date and time in UTC as well.
